This is an ongoing research prototype focused on building interactive XR environments in Unity for human AI interaction.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to explore how conversational AI systems can be integrated into immersive 3D environments to support natural, contextual, and embodied user interaction.

## Core Concepts
- Interactive XR/VR environments in Unity
- AI driven conversational agents
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Persistent conversational memory

## Technology Stack
- Unity 3D (C#)
- Python (Flask API)
- Local Large Language Model (Mistral via Ollama)
- Vector database for memory retrieval
- XR / Meta SDK

## Current Work
