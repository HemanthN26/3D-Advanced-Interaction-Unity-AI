##  Project Overview

This project explores the integration of artificial intelligence and immersive interaction by combining:
- Virtual Reality (VR)
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- 3D Avatars and interaction design
- Real-time UI and multimodal communication in Unity

The objective is to investigate how conversational AI can be embedded into 3D virtual environments to enable natural and interactive human-AI communication beyond traditional chat interfaces.

##  Features

-  AI chatbot integrated with Unity
-  VR environment built in Unity 6
-  AI avatar using Ready Player Me
-  World-space chat UI with history
-  Voice input and text input support
-  Modular architecture (Unity -> Backend -> LLM)

---

##  Tech Stack

**Hardware:**
- Meta Quest 3

**Development:**
- Unity 6
- Meta XR SDK

**AI & Backend:**
- LLM via Groq API (LLaMA / Mistral)
- Whisper (Speech-to-Text)
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)

**Avatar System:**

##  System Architecture
The system follows a modular pipeline:

User Interaction (VR)
- Unity Interaction & UI Layer
- Backend API (LLM & Speech Services)
- AI Response Generation
- Avatar Behaviour & UI Feedback in Unity
  
This architecture enables flexible experimentation with different AI models and interaction techniques.
